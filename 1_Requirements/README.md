# Description 

In vehicles, a wiper control system replaces the standard wiper blade with an electrical component. In this setup, the ignition button (on the motor) will be controlled 
by a single switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper system with a second press, then vary the wiper speed with a third press, and finally turn off the motor 
with a fourth press. All of this was done with the help of LEDs and a simulation tool.

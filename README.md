# M3_Wiper_Control_System

The project's goal is to start the automatic wipers by sensing the intensity of the rain or snow and increasing or reducing the wiper speed accordingly. This automatic wiper system consists of a sensing unit, a controller with a 'STM32F407VG' Microcontroller at its heart, and a motor unit that drives the wiper's arm, allowing for easier wiping.

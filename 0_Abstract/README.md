The automotive industry has been relentlessly researching different ways to harness the power of computing and to make a hopeful shift from mechanisation to automation 
to aid advancements in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles over the last few decades. Every traffic incident that occurs 
throughout the world 24 hours a day has a common cause: attention. As a result, reducing these distractions is always in everyone's best interests.

When driving in the rain or snow, the driver's visibility is hampered, posing a serious hazard to life. The wiper system comes to the rescue in this case. Traditional 
wiper systems, on the other hand, necessitate regular driver attention to alter wiper speed dependent on the severity of rain or snow. Because this manual wiper speed 
change diverts the driver's attention, it may result in an accident, rendering the entire system useless.

To address this issue, the 'Wiper Control System' project is being developed. The goal of this project is to start the automated wiper action by detecting the intensity 
of the rain or snow and adjusting the wiper speed accordingly. This automatic wiper system consists of a sensing unit, a controller with a 'STM32F407VG' Microcontroller 
at its heart, and a motor unit that drives the wiper's arm, allowing for easier wiping.

The proof of concept stage is investigated in this project, so the initial press of a button is regarded to be the starting of ignition. The next three button clicks 
are considered to be the multiple speed control levels supplied by the proposed controller, which range from low to medium to high. The final button press is considered 
to be the ignition switch off. The blue, green, and orange LEDs blink in the desired manner to represent the movement of the wiper arm from left to right and back.
